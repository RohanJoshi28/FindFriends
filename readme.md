Welcome to the findFriends website repository. The purpose of the website is to help in connecting with more people. In this website, users can send and accept friend requests, search for friends, look at the phone numbers and biographies of website users, and see their current friends. New friends recommended on the main page will be friends of the current friends that a user has. A natural language processing system that compares the biographies of recommended friends with the user's biography sorts the recommended friends in order of who shares the most interests. Finally, there is a simple signup system that allows users to signup with their information and then login.
